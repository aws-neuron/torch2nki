nki.language.load_transpose2d

Signature:
nki.language.load_transpose2d(src, *, mask=None, dtype=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Load a tensor from device memory (HBM) and 2D-transpose the data before storing into on-chip memory (SBUF).

Parameters:
src – HBM tensor to load the data from.
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tile.

Returns:
a new tile on SBUF with values from src 2D-transposed.

Example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl
from neuronxcc.nki.typing import tensor
...


# load from in_tensor[F, P] that is on HBM
# transpose and copy into local_tile[P, F] that is on SBUF
N, M = in_tensor.shape
local_tile: tensor[M, N] = nl.load_transpose2d(in_tensor)
...

Note:
Partition dimension size can’t exceed the hardware limitation of nki.language.tile_size.pmax, see Tile size considerations.
