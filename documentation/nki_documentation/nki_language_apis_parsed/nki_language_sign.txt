nki.language.sign

Signature:
nki.language.sign(x, *, dtype=None, mask=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Sign of the numbers of the input, element-wise.
((Similar to numpy.sign))
The sign function returns -1 if x < 0, 0 if x==0, 1 if x > 0.

Parameters:
x – a tile.
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tile.
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)

Returns:
a tile that has sign values of x.
