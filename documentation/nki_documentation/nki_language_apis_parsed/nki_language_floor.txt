Signature:
nki.language.floor(x, *, dtype=None, mask=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Floor of the input, element-wise.
((Similar to numpy.floor))
The floor of the scalar x is the largest integer i, such that i <= x.

Parameters:
x – a tile.
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tile.
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)

Returns:
a tile that has floor values of x.
