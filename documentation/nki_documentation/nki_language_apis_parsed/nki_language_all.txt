nki.language.all

Signature:
nki.language.all(x, axis, *, dtype=<class 'bool'>, mask=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Whether all elements along the specified axis (or axes) evaluate to True.
((Similar to numpy.all))

Parameters:
x – a tile.
axis – int or tuple/list of ints. The axis (or axes) along which to operate; must be free dimensions, not partition dimension (0); can only be the last contiguous dim(s) of the tile: [1], [1,2], [1,2,3], [1,2,3,4]
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tile.
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)

Returns:
a boolean tile with the result. This return tile will have a shape of the input tile’s shape with the specified axes removed.
