nki.language.matmul

Signature:
nki.language.matmul(x, y, *, transpose_x=False, mask=None, **kwargs)

Description:
x @ y matrix multiplication of x and y.
((Similar to numpy.matmul))
Note
For optimal performance on hardware, use nki.isa.nc_matmul() or call nki.language.matmul with transpose_x=True. Use nki.isa.nc_matmul also to access low-level features of the Tensor Engine.
Note
Implementation details: nki.language.matmul calls nki.isa.nc_matmul under the hood. nc_matmul is neuron specific customized implementation of matmul that computes x.T @ y, as a result, matmul(x, y) lowers to nc_matmul(transpose(x), y). To avoid this extra transpose instruction being inserted, use x.T and transpose_x=True inputs to this matmul.

Parameters:
x – a tile on SBUF (partition dimension <= 128, free dimension <= 128), x’s free dimension must match y’s partition dimension.
y – a tile on SBUF (partition dimension <= 128, free dimension <= 512)
transpose_x – Defaults to False. If True, x is treated as already transposed. If False, an additional transpose will be inserted to make x’s partition dimension the contract dimension of the matmul to align with the Tensor Engine.
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)

Returns:
x @ y or x.T @ y if transpose_x=True
