nki.language.all_reduce

Signature:
nki.language.all_reduce(x, op, program_axes, *, dtype=None, mask=None, parallel_reduce=True, asynchronous=False, **kwargs)

Description:
Apply reduce operation over multiple SPMD programs.

Parameters:
x – a tile.
op – numpy ALU operator to use to reduce over the input tile.
program_axes – a single axis or a tuple of axes along which the reduction operation is performed.
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tile.
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)
parallel_reduce – optional boolean parameter whether to turn on parallel reduction. Enable parallel reduction consumes additional memory.
asynchronous – Defaults to False. If True, caller should synchronize before reading final result, e.g. using nki.sync_thread.

Returns:
the reduced resulting tile
