nki.language.rms_norm

Signature:
nki.language.rms_norm(x, w, axis, n, epsilon=1e-06, *, dtype=None, compute_dtype=None, mask=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Apply Root Mean Square Layer Normalization.

Parameters:
x – input tile
w – weight tile
axis – axis along which to compute the root mean square (rms) value
n – total number of values to calculate rms
epsilon – epsilon value used by rms calculation to avoid divide-by-zero
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tile.
compute_dtype – (optional) dtype for the internal computation - currently `dtype` and `compute_dtype` behave the same, both sets internal compute and return dtype.
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)

Returns:
`` x / RMS(x) * w ``
