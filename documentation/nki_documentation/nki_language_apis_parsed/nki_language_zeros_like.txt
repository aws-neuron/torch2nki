nki.language.zeros_like(a, dtype=None, *, buffer=None, name='', **kwargs)

Description:
Create a new tensor of zeros with the same shape and type as a given tensor.
((Similar to numpy.zeros_like))

Parameters:
a – the tensor.
dtype – the data type of the tensor (see Supported Data Types for more information).
buffer – the specific buffer (ie, sbuf, psum, hbm), defaults to sbuf.
