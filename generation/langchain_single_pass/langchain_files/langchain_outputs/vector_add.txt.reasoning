To resolve the "Insufficient rank!" error, I'll modify the kernel to explicitly create a 2D tensor with a single column, ensuring the input has the correct rank for NKI tensor operations by using a tuple for the shape parameter.
```

=== Iteration 2 ===
```
To resolve the "Insufficient rank!" error, I'll modify the kernel to explicitly create a 2D tensor with two dimensions, ensuring proper tensor rank and alignment for NKI tensor operations by using a tuple for the shape parameter with a specific column dimension.

=== Iteration 3 ===
```
To resolve the "Only support multi-dimensional subscript to arange!" error, I'll modify the kernel to use explicit multi-dimensional indexing with nl.mgrid and create a 2D tensor with proper rank and dimension handling.

```

=== Iteration 1 ===
```
The error "Insufficient rank!" suggests we need to modify the kernel to explicitly create a 2D tensor by adding a partition dimension, ensuring the tensor has sufficient rank for NKI processing.
```

=== Iteration 2 ===
```
Use a fixed 2D tensor with a single partition dimension and ensure nl.zeros() receives a tuple with at least two dimensions to satisfy NKI's rank requirements.
```

=== Iteration 1 ===
```
The error suggests we need a 2D tensor with a partition dimension, so we'll modify the kernel to use a 2D shape with an explicit partition dimension for NKI compatibility.
```

=== Iteration 2 ===
```
The kernel requires a 2D tensor with a partition dimension as the first dimension, so we'll modify the input handling to create a 2D tensor with a single partition dimension and use MGGrid for indexing.
```

=== Iteration 1 ===
```
The error indicates insufficient tensor rank, so we'll modify the kernel to ensure a 2D tensor representation with explicit partition and free dimensions, using a more robust NKI tensor handling approach.
```

=== Iteration 2 ===
```
We'll explicitly ensure a 2D tensor representation by expanding the input vector to a 2D shape with a single column, which should resolve the insufficient rank issue by providing a clear partition and free dimension.
```

=== Iteration 3 ===
```
We'll modify the kernel to explicitly create a 2D tensor with a single column by using NKI's indexing and explicitly constructing the tensor dimensions.
