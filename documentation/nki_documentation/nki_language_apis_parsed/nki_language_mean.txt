nki.language.mean

Signature:
nki.language.mean(x, axis, *, dtype=None, mask=None, keepdims=False, **kwargs)

Description:
Arithmetic mean along the specified axis (or axes) of the input.
((Similar to numpy.mean))

Parameters:
x – a tile.
axis – int or tuple/list of ints. The axis (or axes) along which to operate; must be free dimensions, not partition dimension (0); can only be the last contiguous dim(s) of the tile: [1], [1,2], [1,2,3], [1,2,3,4]
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tile.
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)

Returns:
a tile with the average of elements along the provided axis. This return tile will have a shape of the input tile’s shape with the specified axes removed. float32 intermediate and return values are used for integer inputs.
