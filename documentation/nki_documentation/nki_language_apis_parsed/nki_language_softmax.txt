nki.language.softmax

Signature:
nki.language.softmax(x, axis, *, dtype=None, compute_dtype=None, mask=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Softmax activation function on the input, element-wise.
((Similar to torch.nn.functional.softmax))

Parameters:
x – a tile.
axis – int or tuple/list of ints. The axis (or axes) along which to operate; must be free dimensions, not partition dimension (0); can only be the last contiguous dim(s) of the tile: [1], [1,2], [1,2,3], [1,2,3,4]
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tile.
compute_dtype – (optional) dtype for the internal computation - currently `dtype` and `compute_dtype` behave the same, both sets internal compute and return dtype.
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)

Returns:
a tile that has softmax of x.
