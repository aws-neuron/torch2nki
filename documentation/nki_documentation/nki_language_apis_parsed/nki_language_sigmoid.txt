nki.language.sigmoid

Signature:
nki.language.sigmoid(x, *, dtype=None, mask=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Logistic sigmoid activation function on the input, element-wise.
((Similar to torch.nn.functional.sigmoid))
sigmoid(x) = 1/(1+exp(-x))

Parameters:
x – a tile.
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tile.
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)

Returns:
a tile that has sigmoid of x.
