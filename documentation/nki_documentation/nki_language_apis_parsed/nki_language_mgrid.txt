nki.language.mgrid

Signature:
nki.language.mgrid = Ellipsis

Description:
Same as NumPy mgrid: “An instance which returns a dense (or fleshed out) mesh-grid when indexed, so that each returned argument has the same shape. The dimensions and number of the output arrays are equal to the number of indexing dimensions.”
Complex numbers are not supported in the step length.
((Similar to numpy.mgrid))

Example:
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl
...


i_p, i_f = nl.mgrid[0:128, 0:512]
tile = nl.load(in_tensor[i_p, i_f])
...
nl.store(out_tensor[i_p, i_f], tile)
import neuronxcc.nki.language as nl
...


grid = nl.mgrid[0:128, 0:512]
tile = nl.load(in_tensor[grid.p, grid.x])
...
nl.store(out_tensor[grid.p, grid.x], tile)
