nki.language.trunc

Signature:
nki.language.trunc(x, *, dtype=None, mask=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Truncated value of the input, element-wise.
((Similar to numpy.trunc))
The truncated value of the scalar x is the nearest integer i which is closer to zero than x is. In short, the fractional part of the signed number x is discarded.

Parameters:
x – a tile.
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tile.
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)

Returns:
a tile that has truncated values of x.
