nki.language.invert

Signature:
nki.language.invert(x, *, dtype=None, mask=None, **kwargs)

Description:
Bitwise NOT of the input, element-wise.
((Similar to numpy.invert))
Computes the bit-wise NOT of the underlying binary representation of the integers in the input tile. This ufunc implements the C/Python operator ~

Parameters:
x – a tile.
dtype – (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see Supported Data Types for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tile.
mask – (optional) a compile-time constant predicate that controls whether/how this instruction is executed (see NKI API Masking for details)

Returns:
a tile with bitwise NOT x element-wise.
