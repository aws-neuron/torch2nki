=== Change Report for Iteration 2 ===
1. **Did the fix resolve the initial problem?** No.

2. **Explanation:** The initial problem regarding the "Only support multi-dimensional subscript to arange!" error was addressed by switching from `nl.arange` to `nl.mgrid`, which is suitable for multi-dimensional indexing. However, the new error "Expected 1 indices, got 2" indicates that the subsequent code still attempted to access a multi-dimensional tensor with two indices (`v1[i_p, i_f]`). This suggests that the kernel code did not properly adapt to the new indexing method, leading to an assertion failure when the code expected a single index instead of two. The fix did not fully account for the tensor's dimensionality in the subsequent operations.
