*** The "Insufficient rank!" error continues to suggest that the dimensionality of the output tensor is not meeting the expectations of the NKI framework during kernel execution. To address this issue, I will create the result tensor with a shape of `(size,)` and ensure that I properly handle the indexing during storage operations in a way that maintains the expected rank of values being stored. Furthermore, I will ensure the computation involves scalar values to simplify the operation and avoid rank-related complications. ***
